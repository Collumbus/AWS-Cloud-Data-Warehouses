# Project: Build A Cloud Data Warehouse
It is a data warehouse project on AWS where has built an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, we load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables. 

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Datasets

You'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

   * Song data: ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data```
   * Log data: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data```

Log data json path: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json```

## Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

## Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator based](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Project Structure

```
Cloud Data Warehouse
|____create_tables.py    # Database/table creation script 
|____etl.py              # ELT builder
|____sql_queries.py      # SQL query collections
|____dwh.cfg             # AWS configuration file
|____tester.ipynb        # Test all proccess
```

## ELT Pipeline
#### etl.py

ELT pipeline builder

1. ```load_staging_tables```
    * Load raw data from S3 buckets to Redshift staging tables
2. ```insert_tables```
    * Transform staging table data to dimensional tables for data analysis

#### create_tables.py

Creating Staging, Fact and Dimension table schema

1. ```drop_tables```
2. ```create_tables```

#### sql_queries.py

SQL query statement collecitons for ```create_tables.py``` and ```etl.py```

1. ```*_table_drop```
2. ```*_table_create```
3. ```staging_*_copy```
4. ```*_table_insert```

## Running the project

To test the entire project flow we can run the tester.ipynb notebook. In this file, there are also example queries for data verification in dwh.
